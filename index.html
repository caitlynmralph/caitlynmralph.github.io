                <p>but, the journey started in high school when i did a four-year science fair project in cognitive psychology.</p>
                <p>i attended the international fair twice, placing third globally in my category senior year.</p>
                <p>in 2017, i was honored as a goldwater scholar.</p>

                <p>you'll probably catch me talking about a band called inhaler, oasis in 1996, julian casablancas (just, you know, as a <em>concept</em>), arlo parks' poetry, how much i adore sam fender, and theories about where on earth van mccann has <strong>been</strong> (if you have any ideas, email me).</p>
                <p>if any of that even made a moment of sense to you, check out some dumb playlists on my spotify <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/earthto_caitlyn?si=61def9d15ec3489e">here</a>.</p>
